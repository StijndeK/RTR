# RTR (MVP)
These issues, RTR attempts to tackle for risers.
Risers are interesting because.
Industry relevance
Low level audio combination of FMOD low level and layer-based system build on top of it.

*image both dataflows*
Info both dataflows, and difference between engine specific and general low level audio system. Easy to create integration for other

## Current stage: MVP reached

## Improvements
### UI to add
- *ranges and curves for modulation*
- modulation direction
- curve
- visualisation (drawing)
### features to add
- panning
- panning modulation
- *controll over parameter linking and grouping*
- get minimum attack time from engine
- mock improvements (dont have to do by hand)
- *predict player time to goal and improve / lessen attack up speed*
- some wait or slow down time before turning 
### cleanup
- remove global variables
- *setters and getters cleanup*
- *link audio element to a parameter*
